## 1. Problem Statement

[cite_start]Globally, 2.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water[cite: 6]. [cite_start]This project tackles water scarcity in rural, disaster-hit areas and for military personnel [cite: 7][cite_start], addressing the unsustainability of bottled water and the inefficiency of classical optimization methods in unpredictable environments[cite: 8, 9].

## 2. Our Solution

A portable, solar-powered backpack that generates clean water from atmospheric humidity. [cite_start]The system's efficiency is dynamically optimized using quantum computing algorithms to overcome the classical bottleneck of managing too many changing environmental parameters[cite: 11].

**Working Principle:**
* [cite_start]A fan pulls in humid air[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]Peltier modules cool the air, causing water to condense[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]The water undergoes a three-stage purification process (HEPA, Carbon, UV)[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]Clean, potable water is collected in a storage tank[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]The entire system is powered by an integrated solar panel and battery system[cite: 26].

## 3. The Quantum Advantage

[cite_start]We leverage quantum computing for superior performance where classical methods struggle[cite: 11]:

* [cite_start]**Optimization (QAOA):** Optimizes the cooling process and power utilization for maximum efficiency[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**Prediction (QML):** Uses Quantum Machine Learning to predict water yield in real-time based on current conditions[cite: 14].
* [cite_start]**Simulation:** Quantum simulation is used to model condensation efficiency and virtually test new hardware designs[cite: 15].

## 4. Tech Stack

* [cite_start]**Hardware:** Arduino/ESP32, Peltier Modules, Sensors, Solar Panel, Battery[cite: 36, 37, 38, 39, 40].
* [cite_start]**Software & Algorithms:** Python, Qiskit, IoT Dashboard, QAOA, Quantum SVM/Neural Nets, Quantum Simulation tools[cite: 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48].

## 5. Installation and Setup

**(This is a required section. Be very clear here!)**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sarthaklabhade1212/Quantum-Water-Generator.git](https://github.com/sarthaklabhade1212/Quantum-Water-Generator.git)
    cd Quantum-Water-Generator
    ```
2.  Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Set up hardware... (provide instructions for your Arduino/ESP32).

## 6. How to Run the Demo

1.  To run the QAOA optimization simulation, execute the following command:
    ```bash
    python code/qaoa_optimization.py
    ```
2.  To view the QML prediction model, open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook code/qml_prediction.ipynb
    ```
