## 1. Problem Statement

Globally, 2.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water.
This project tackles water scarcity in rural, disaster-hit areas and for military personnel, addressing the unsustainability of bottled water and the inefficiency of classical optimization methods in unpredictable environments.

## 2. Our Solution

A portable, solar-powered backpack that generates clean water from atmospheric humidity. 
The system's efficiency is dynamically optimized using quantum computing algorithms to overcome the classical bottleneck of managing too many changing environmental parameters.

**Working Principle:**
* A fan pulls in humid air.
* Peltier modules cool the air, causing water to condense.
* The water undergoes a three-stage purification process (HEPA, Carbon, UV).
* Clean, potable water is collected in a storage tank.
* The entire system is powered by an integrated solar panel and battery system.

## 3. The Quantum Advantage

We leverage quantum computing for superior performance where classical methods struggle:

* **Optimization (QAOA):** Optimizes the cooling process and power utilization for maximum efficiency.
* **Prediction (QML):** Uses Quantum Machine Learning to predict water yield in real-time based on current conditions.
* **Simulation:** Quantum simulation is used to model condensation efficiency and virtually test new hardware designs.

## 4. Tech Stack

* **Hardware:** Arduino/ESP32, Peltier Modules, Sensors, Solar Panel, Battery.
* **Software & Algorithms:** Python, Qiskit, IoT Dashboard, QAOA, Quantum SVM/Neural Nets, Quantum Simulation tools.

## 5. Installation and Setup

**(This is a required section. Be very clear here!)**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sarthaklabhade1212/Quantum-Water-Generator.git](https://github.com/sarthaklabhade1212/Quantum-Water-Generator.git)
    cd Quantum-Water-Generator
    ```
2.  Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Set up hardware... (provide instructions for your Arduino/ESP32).

## 6. How to Run the Demo

1.  To run the QAOA optimization simulation, execute the following command:
    ```bash
    python code/qaoa_optimization.py
    ```
2.  To view the QML prediction model, open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook code/qml_prediction.ipynb
    ```
